Wallet Instance
---------------

The Wallet Instance establishes a strong and reliable mechanism for the User to engage in various digital transactions in a secure and privacy-preserving manner.

The Wallet Instance allows other entities within the ecosystem to establish trust with it, by consistently
presenting a Wallet Attestation during interactions with PID Providers,
(Q)EAA Providers, and Relying Parties. These verifiable attestations, provided by the Wallet Provider,
serve to authenticate the Wallet Instance itself, ensuring its reliability when engaging with other ecosystem actors.
