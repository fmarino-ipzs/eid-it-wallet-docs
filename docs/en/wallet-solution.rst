Wallet Solution
---------------

The Wallet Solution is issued by the Wallet Provider in the form of a mobile app and services, such as web interfaces. The mobile app serves as the primary interface for Users, allowing them to hold their Digital Credentials and interact with other participants of the ecosystem, such as Credential Issuers and Relying Parties. These Credentials are a set of data that can uniquely identify a natural or legal person, along with other Qualified and non-qualified Electronic Attestations of Attributes, also known as QEAAs and EAAs respectively, or (Q)EAAs for short. Once a User installs the mobile app on their device, such an installation is referred to as a Wallet Instance for the User. By supporting the mobile app, the Wallet Provider ensures the security and reliability of the entire Wallet Solution, as it is responsible for issuing the Wallet Attestation, which is a cryptographic proof about the authenticity and integrity of the Wallet Instance.
