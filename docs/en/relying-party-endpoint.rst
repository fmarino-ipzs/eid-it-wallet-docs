Relying Party Endpoints
=========================

The Relying Party MUST expose a trust endpoint adhering to the OpenID Federation 1.0 Wallet Architecture specification, facilitating the Relying Party's identity and metadata distribution. In addition, in case the Relying Party supports proximity presentation, it MUST expose a set of endpoints for handling the lifecycle of Relying Party Instances (e.g., by providing nonce generation, hardware key registration, integrity validation, and Access Certificate issuance); their specific implementation details are left to the Relying Party's discretion.


Relying Party Federation Endpoint
-----------------------------------

.. include:: relying-party-entity-configuration.rst


Relying Party Nonce Endpoint
----------------------------------

The Relying Party Nonce Endpoint allows the Relying Party Instance to request a cryptographic ``nonce`` from the Relying Party Backend. The ``nonce`` serves as an unpredictable, single-use challenge to ensure freshness and prevent replay attacks.

Further details on the Nonce Request and Response are provided in the :ref:`Mobile Application Nonce Request` and :ref:`Mobile Application Nonce Response` sections, respectively.


Relying Party Instance Initialization Endpoint
---------------------------------------------------

The Relying Party Instance Initialization Endpoint allows for the initialization of Relying Party Instances, consisting in the registration of a pair of long-lived, securely stored Cryptographic Hardware Keys.

Further details on the Relying Party Instance Initialization Request and Response are provided in the :ref:`Mobile Application Instance Initialization Request` and :ref:`Mobile Application Instance Initialization Response` sections, respectively.


Relying Party Key Binding Endpoint
----------------------------------------------

The Relying Party Key Binding Endpoint enables Relying Party Instances to bind the newly created pair of keys, which will be associated with an Access Certificate, to the Relying Party Instance, by relying on a proof of possession of the Cryptographic Hardware Keys generated during the :ref:`Mobile Application Instance Initialization` phase. Before completing the process, the Relying Party Backend also needs to verify the integrity of the Relying Party Instance.


Relying Party Key Binding Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Further details on the Relying Party Key Binding Request are provided in the :ref:`Mobile Application Key Binding Request` section.

The ``typ`` header of the Integrity Request JWT assumes the value ``rp-kb+jwt``.


Relying Party Key Binding Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upon a successful request, the Application Provider provides an HTTP Response with a ``204 No Content`` status code.

Below is a non-normative example of a Key Binding Request Response.

.. code-block:: http
  
    HTTP/1.1 204 No content

If any errors occur during the process, an error response is returned. Further details on the error response are provided in the :ref:`Mobile Application Key Binding Error Response` section.


Relying Party Access Certificate Endpoint
----------------------------------------------

The Relying Party Access Certificate Endpoint enables Relying Party Instances to obtain an Access Certificate.


Relying Party Access Certificate Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Access Certificate Request uses the HTTP POST method with ``Content-Type`` set to ``application/json``.

The request includes the following body parameters:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Parameter**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **csr**
      - The CSR generated by the Relying Party Instance, encoded in the ``base64url`` format as defined in :rfc:`2511`.
      - 

Below is a non-normative example of an Access Certificate Request.

.. code-block:: http

    POST /access-certificate HTTP/1.1
    Host: relying-party.example.org
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "csr": "MIIBvzCCAa..."
    }


Relying Party Access Certificate Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upon a successful request, the Relying Party Access Certificate Endpoint provides an HTTP Response with a ``200 OK`` status code and the Access Certificate. The Access Certificate Response, which uses ``application/json`` as the ``Content-Type``, includes the following body parameters:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Parameter**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **access_certificate**
      - The Access Certificate generated by the CSR.
      - 

Below is a non-normative example of an Access Certificate Response.

.. code-block:: http

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "access_certificate": "hajdnhaghSDGns..."
    }

If any errors occur, the Relying Party Access Certificate Endpoint returns an error response. The response uses ``application/json`` as the content type and includes the following parameters:

  - *error*. The error code.
  - *error_description*. Text in human-readable form providing further details to clarify the nature of the error encountered.

Below is a non-normative example of an Access Certificate Error Response.

.. code-block:: http
    
    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "error": "invalid_request",
        "error_description": "The public key in the CSR is different from the one associated with the Cryptographic Hardware Keys."
    }

The following table lists HTTP Status Codes and related error codes that MUST be supported for the error response, unless otherwise specified:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 30 20 50
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **HTTP Status Code**
      - **Error Code**
      - **Description**
    * - ``400 Bad Request``
      - ``bad_request``
      - The request is malformed, missing required parameters (e.g., header parameters or integrity assertion), or includes invalid and unknown parameters.
    * - ``403 Forbidden``
      - ``invalid_request``
      - The public key in the CSR does not match the public key associated with the Cryptographic Hardware Keys.
    * - ``500 Internal Server Error``
      - ``server_error``
      - The request cannot be fulfilled because the Endpoint encountered an internal problem.
    * - ``503 Service Unavailable``
      - ``temporarily_unavailable``
      - The request cannot be fulfilled because the Endpoint is temporarily unavailable (e.g., due to maintenance or overload).
